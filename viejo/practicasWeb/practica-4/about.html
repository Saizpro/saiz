      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h2>Our Model</h2>
      <p><strong>Let's face it, plenty of restaurant websites have the right intentions but fail to deliver</strong>. They'll use flash, add music and have no easy way of updating it. As a result, they're hard to navigate (or even access at all) and end up just frustrating potential clients. It is our goal to become the premium provider of affordable and <strong>powerful websites for independent restaurant owners</strong>.</p>
      <h2>Our Advantage</h2>
      <p>We're dedicated to <strong>helping your revenue grow</strong> by focusing on issues that matter. Our websites are conitually analyzed to maxmimize your potential to convert an online user. We provide a lot of basic features such as food menu and event management, but have also completely automated mobile and search engine optimization. Our unique mix of skills and knowledge along with the constant desire for improvement gives us a real advantage. Whilst there's no minimum term or setup fee, we still view your business as a relationship.</p>
